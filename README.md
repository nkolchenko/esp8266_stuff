# esp8266_stuff

Some sketches/scripts/etc I did for my Lolin ESP8266 NodeMCU v3 dev-board. 

The fastest and easiest way to proceed with it is to: 
* install CH340G driver from https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver
* install ArduinoIDE :) and insert Link for .json NodeMCU package files into Arduino IDE http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json from http://www.instructables.com/id/Programming-ESP8266-ESP-12E-NodeMCU-Using-Arduino-/
